# API Stub

These files reserve a place for future Azure Functions or API routes. The frontend currently uses a touch-friendly `src/services/api.ts` that tries real `/api/*` endpoints first, then falls back to localStorage-backed data. You can replace this folder with a Functions app later if you want to wire up real endpoints.
